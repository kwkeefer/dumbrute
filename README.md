# dumbrute

> An http brute forcing tool designed to use the Python requests module

Because I can't afford a Burp Pro license.

I got sick of fiddling with Hydra and wanted something a bit more flexible that didn't take forever to run.

After installing run:

```shell
dumbrute .
```

This will create a `dumbrute_example.py` file in your local directory.  From here you can edit the request however you need to, then run the script to start a brute force.
